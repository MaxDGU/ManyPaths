# Specific PDF to exclude if it was a mistake to include all PDFs before
# If GoodmanTenenbaum2008-CognitiveScience.pdf IS to be tracked, remove it from here
# OR comment out the *.pdf line above and list specific PDFs to ignore.
# For now, assuming all PDFs are by default ignored, unless explicitly added.
# To track a specific PDF like Goodman... then it must be force added (git add -f ...)
# or the *.pdf line removed/commented.

# If you want to keep GoodmanTenenbaum2008-CognitiveScience.pdf, 
# it's better to remove '*.pdf' above and be explicit about other PDFs to ignore,
# or use `git add -f GoodmanTenenbaum2008-CognitiveScience.pdf` later.
# For now, the *.pdf line will ignore it.
