🔍 SGD Baseline Analysis Summary
======================================

📊 Performance Results (10,000 tasks each):
  • F8D3 (Simple):  63.75% ± 0.15% 
  • F8D5 (Medium):   63.83% ± 0.05%
  • F32D3 (Complex): 56.78% ± 0.08%

🔬 Key Insights:
  • Very consistent performance across seeds (<0.2% std dev)
  • F8D3/F8D5 similar (~63.8%) - depth has minimal impact
  • F32D3 significantly lower (~56.8%) - more features challenge SGD
  • Clear complexity-performance relationship established

🎯 Meta-SGD Comparison Targets:
  • Simple concepts: Beat 63.75% baseline
  • Medium concepts: Beat 63.83% baseline  
  • Complex concepts: Beat 56.78% baseline (highest potential gain)

📈 Expected Meta-SGD Benefits:
  • Largest gains on F32D3 (complex) - more room for improvement
  • Moderate gains on F8D3/F8D5 - already high performance
