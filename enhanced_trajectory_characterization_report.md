## Meta-SGD Adaptive Mechanisms

This analysis characterizes how Meta-SGD learns both gradient update directions and magnitudes, contrasting with SGD's fixed optimization strategy.

### Key Findings
1. **Adaptive Step Sizes**: Meta-SGD varies step sizes based on local landscape curvature
2. **Learned Gradient Directions**: Meta-SGD discovers optimal search directions beyond standard gradients
3. **Dynamic Learning Phases**: Meta-SGD adapts exploration/exploitation balance
4. **Concept-Specific Strategies**: Optimization approach tailored to problem complexity
