## Camera-Ready Insights

### Key Findings for Paper
1. **More Gradient Steps → Better Generalization**: K=10 consistently outperforms K=1
2. **Complexity Scaling**: Complex concepts (F16D3) show larger improvements than simple ones (F8D3)
3. **Consistent Benefits**: Improvements are consistent across different seeds
4. **Sample Efficiency**: K=10 reaches target accuracy thresholds faster

### Mechanistic Explanations
- Additional gradient steps enable better adaptation to complex concept structure
- Meta-learning benefits increase with concept complexity
- Second-order gradients capture more nuanced patterns

### Next Steps
1. Push this analysis to git repository
2. Pull locally for publication-quality figure generation
3. Integrate with loss landscape topology analysis
4. Generate final camera-ready figures
5. Complete manuscript revisions
